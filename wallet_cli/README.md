# CLI wallet 

Hedera Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet is a basic, free (like in free beer), open-source program that enables the following services on Hedera Hashgraph testnet and mainnet networks:
 * account creation
 * transfer of hbar to any account
 * getting the balance of any account
 * getting the info of any account (primary form for now)
 * staking (coming soon)
 * support of multiple accounts


## Installation

Now the wallet can be installed as any nodejs program:

```bash
> cd hedera_cli-main
> cd wallet_cli
> npm install
> sudo npm link
```

## Usage
Before using the wallet, update the .env file present in the wallet_cli directory with the account credentials of the testnet or mainnet that is needed. 

Note: the github repo will contain a .env file that contains a valid testnet account, however, this account will be removed once the testnet is upgraded or it cannot be used if there is not enough hbars in it.
 
The wallet can be tested with:

```bash
> wallet -h
```

To get help for a given command, use:
```bash
> wallet <command_name> -h
```
e.g.
```bash
> wallet transfer-hbar -h
```

Examples of comamnds:
```bash
> wallet transfer-hbar --amount 2 --account-id 0.0.477 --network test
> wallet get-balance --account-id 0.0.477 --network test
> wallet create-account --amount 12.34 --memo "green account" --network test --assoc 777 --max-fee 100
```

**Important:** *when a new account is created, the credentials of the account are saved in a file that has the same name as the new account created (format x.y.z) and it is located in the home directory of the user. The format of the data in this file is identical with the one of the .env file, so it can easily be copied in the wallet_cli directory with the name .env and used as a new account. The files that contain the information of the new accounts must be properly saved.*


**Note:** *If the max-fee number is too low, the following error will be generated by Hedera network:
PrecheckStatusError: transaction 0.0.5678@1658703257.640157117 failed precheck with status INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE
In this case, the --max-fee value must be increased*


## About the .env file
The **.env** file is the most sensitive file because it contains the credentials of the account. It is the user responsibility to make sure that the information in this file is correct and properly stored. The **.env** file belongs to the directory wallet_cli.

The format of the data in the .env file is:
```bash
ACCOUNT_ID=<x.y.z>
PUBLIC_KEY=<public key as string>
PRIVATE_KEY=<private key as string>
```
